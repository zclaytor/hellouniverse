    "In this notebook, you will walk through the basic steps of applying a CNN to data:\n",
    "1. Load the data and visualize a sample of the data.\n",
    "2. Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
    "3. Build a CNN in `Keras`.\n",

    "## FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do I interpret theses results?** The confusion matrix shows the model predicts a large fraction of false positive (roughly 25%) and false negative (roughly 36%) merger events. The published models from [Ciprijanovic et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2020.100390) perform much better.  We note that in this notebook we are training for only a subset of the optimal number of epochs for space and time considerations, but you are welcome to agument these restricitons, and as always check out [the DeepMerge code](https://github.com/deepskies/deepmerge-public) for more information!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I improve the model by changing it?** We only trained for 20 epochs, which is many fewer than the published model. Go back to Section 4 (\"Train the CNN to perform a classification task\") and increase the number of epochs to 100 (or more!) and train again. Does your model perform better? Your results may look better/worse/different from the published results due to the stochastic nature of training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can I try a different model?  I think the results could be improved.** Yes!  You can try adding layers, swapping out the max pooling, changing the activation functions, swapping out the loss function, or trying a different optimizer or learning rate.  Experiment and see what model changes give the best results. You should be aware:  when you start training again, you pick up where your model left off.  If you want to \"reset\" your model to epoch 0 and random weights, you should run the cells to make and compile the model again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I want to test my model on my training data!** No. You will convince yourself that your results are much better than they actually are.  Always keep your training, validation, and testing sets completely separate!\n"

    "- **Effect of noise?** Try re-training the network with \"noisy\" data (i.e., modify the `version` in Section 1 to \"noisy\" and download the associated data product). Do the results change? If so, how and why? What are the pros and cons of using noisy vs. pristine data to train a ML model? \n",

    "- **Effect of wavelength?** The [DEEPMERGE HLSP](https://archive.stsci.edu/doi/resolve/resolve.html?doi=10.17909/t9-vqk6-pc80) includes mock galaxy images in 2 filters only (only HST data). If you train the network with this data (hint: this will require downloading it from the website, or modifying the download cells to point to the correct URL; and also modifying the shapes of the training, validation and test data, as well as the network inputs), how do the results change? \n",

    "- **Early stopping?** The DeepMerge team employed \"early stopping\" to minimize overfitting. Try implementing it in the network here! The Keras library for [early stopping](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/early_stopping/) functions will be useful. For example, you can recompile the model, train for many more epochs, and include a `callback`, in `cnn.train` e.g.,\n",
